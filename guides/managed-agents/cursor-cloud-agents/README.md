# Cursor Self-Hosted Machines on Superserve

Run [Cursor Cloud Agents](https://cursor.com/docs/cloud-agent) on [Superserve sandboxes](https://superserve.ai) through a Self-Hosted Machines team pool.

Self-Hosted Machines lets you move a Cloud Agent's checkout, edits, and shell commands onto machines you control, but a Team Pool means managing a fleet of machines. Superserve gives you the control without having to manage one: every request gets its own sandbox, booted from your template, limited to an egress allowlist if you set one, and deleted when the worker exits, or paused between follow-ups if you enable hibernation.

Cursor runs the agent loop. Superserve runs the worker. A spawn hook and a monitor wire them together.

## How it fits together

- [**Cursor Cloud Agents**](https://cursor.com/docs/cloud-agent/self-hosted) — Cursor's background agents. With Self-Hosted Machines, the agent loop and model calls stay with Cursor while the checkout, edits, and shell commands run on a worker you provide.
- [**`agent worker controller`**](https://cursor.com/docs/cloud-agent/self-hosted/pool#worker-controller) — Cursor's built-in controller. It claims pending pool requests and runs a spawn hook once per claim.
- [**Superserve**](https://docs.superserve.ai) — isolated sandboxes. Each worker gets its own sandbox with a full filesystem, shell, and network namespace. Sandboxes boot in under 50ms and can be paused between turns.

The spawn hook creates a sandbox per claim and starts `agent worker` inside it under the worker id Cursor assigned. The monitor deletes the sandbox when the worker exits, or pauses it when hibernation is on so a follow-up resumes on the same workspace.

## Code at a glance

Build a template once — every worker boots from it:

```typescript
import { Template } from "@superserve/sdk"

const template = await Template.create({
  name: "cursor-worker",
  from: "ubuntu:24.04",
  vcpu: 2,
  memoryMib: 2048,
  diskMib: 8192,
  steps: [
    {
      run: "apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends ca-certificates curl git jq procps unzip && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*",
    },
    { run: "curl -fsS https://cursor.com/install | HOME=/root bash" },
    {
      run: "ln -sf /root/.local/bin/agent /usr/local/bin/agent && agent --version",
    },
    { run: "mkdir -p /workspace /var/lib/cursor-worker" },
    { workdir: "/workspace" },
  ],
})
await template.waitUntilReady()
```

The spawn hook creates a sandbox for the claim and launches the worker:

```typescript
const sandbox = await Sandbox.create({
  name: `cursor-${workerId.slice(0, 12)}`,
  fromTemplate: "cursor-worker",
  metadata: {
    "cursor.managed": "true",
    "cursor.worker_id": workerId,
    "cursor.pool": pool,
  },
  autoDeleteSeconds: 86_400, // reap if left paused for a day
})

// launch.sh detaches and runs:  agent worker --pool <pool> --clone-git-repos start
await sandbox.commands.run("bash /var/lib/cursor-worker/launch.sh", {
  env: {
    CURSOR_API_KEY: process.env.CURSOR_API_KEY,
    CURSOR_AGENT_WORKER_ID: workerId,
    CURSOR_WORKER_IDLE_RELEASE_TIMEOUT: "600",
  },
})
```

`CURSOR_API_KEY` is passed to the worker process. The agent's commands run as the same user as the worker, so treat the pool as one trust boundary and scope the service account to it. `SUPERSERVE_API_KEY` never enters the sandbox.

See the [full guide](https://docs.superserve.ai/integrations/managed-agents/cursor-cloud-agents) for the Cursor admin setup, egress rules, and hibernation.

## Prerequisites

- A [Superserve account](https://console.superserve.ai) and API key
- A Cursor Enterprise plan with Self-Hosted Machines and GitHub token minting enabled by a team admin
- A Cursor **service-account** API key — the only key type that can start pool workers
- The Cursor CLI on the controller host, plus Node.js 22+ or Python 3.12+

## Quick start

Both TypeScript and Python implementations are included.

### TypeScript

```bash
cd typescript
npm install
cp .env.example .env  # add SUPERSERVE_API_KEY and CURSOR_API_KEY
```

| Script               | What it does                                                          |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `build-template.mjs` | Builds the `cursor-worker` template (Ubuntu 24.04 + Cursor CLI)       |
| `spawn.mjs`          | `--spawn` hook: creates a sandbox and starts the worker in it         |
| `monitor.mjs`        | Deletes or pauses sandboxes whose worker exited; wakes them on demand |

```bash
node build-template.mjs   # one-time

# terminal 1: the controller (a Cursor binary, so export .env for it)
set -a && . ./.env && set +a
agent worker controller --spawn "$(pwd)/spawn.mjs" --pool superserve

# terminal 2: the monitor
node monitor.mjs
```

### Python

```bash
cd python
uv venv && uv pip install -e .
cp .env.example .env  # add SUPERSERVE_API_KEY and CURSOR_API_KEY
```

| Script              | What it does                                                          |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `build_template.py` | Builds the `cursor-worker` template (Ubuntu 24.04 + Cursor CLI)       |
| `spawn.sh`          | `--spawn` hook wrapper around `spawn.py`                              |
| `monitor.py`        | Deletes or pauses sandboxes whose worker exited; wakes them on demand |

```bash
.venv/bin/python build_template.py   # one-time

# terminal 1: the controller (a Cursor binary, so export .env for it)
set -a && . ./.env && set +a
agent worker controller --spawn "$(pwd)/spawn.sh" --pool superserve

# terminal 2: the monitor
.venv/bin/python monitor.py
```

Then create a Cloud Agent in Cursor and select the `superserve` pool. The sandbox appears in the console as `cursor-<worker id>`; its worker log is at `/var/lib/cursor-worker/worker.log`.

## Configuration

The scripts read these from `.env`:

| Setting                              | Default         | What it controls                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SUPERSERVE_API_KEY`                 | required        | Sandbox creation, resume, and deletion                                                                                        |
| `CURSOR_API_KEY`                     | required        | Service-account key for the controller, handed to each worker                                                                 |
| `CURSOR_POOL`                        | required        | Pool name. The controller sets it for the spawn hook; the monitor reads it from `.env` and only touches that pool's sandboxes |
| `CURSOR_WORKER_TEMPLATE`             | `cursor-worker` | Template each sandbox boots from                                                                                              |
| `CURSOR_WORKER_IDLE_RELEASE_TIMEOUT` | `600`           | Seconds a worker waits for follow-ups before exiting                                                                          |
| `CURSOR_WORKER_CLONE_GIT_REPOS`      | `true`          | Start the worker with `--clone-git-repos`. Turn off for any-repo workers that handle their own checkout                       |
| `CURSOR_WORKER_HIBERNATE`            | `false`         | Pause sandboxes on worker exit instead of deleting them                                                                       |
| `SANDBOX_AUTO_DELETE_SECONDS`        | `86400`         | How long a sandbox may stay paused before it is deleted                                                                       |
| `CURSOR_WORKER_ALLOW_OUT`            | unset           | Comma-separated egress allowlist. Unset keeps the open default                                                                |
| `MONITOR_POLL_SECONDS`               | `15`            | Monitor sweep interval                                                                                                        |
| `MONITOR_GRACE_SECONDS`              | `120`           | Minimum sandbox age before the monitor may recycle it                                                                         |
| `MONITOR_WAKE_CONCURRENCY`           | `4`             | How many hibernated sandboxes the monitor wakes at once when follow-ups arrive in a burst                                     |

The controller sets `CURSOR_AGENT_WORKER_ID`, `CURSOR_REQUEST_ID`, and `CURSOR_WORKER_NAME` on each spawn. Leave them out of `.env`.
