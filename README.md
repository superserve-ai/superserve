## Features

- **Sandboxed execution** — Every agent runs in a gVisor-isolated container with its own compute, filesystem, and network
- **Persistent workspace** — Storage that survives restarts. Agents pick up where they left off
- **Encrypted secrets** — API keys are encrypted and injected at runtime. Values are never exposed
- **Real-time streaming** — Stream tokens and tool calls as they happen
- **Sub-second cold starts** — Pre-provisioned containers mean your agent starts almost instantly
- **Built for Claude Agent SDK** — Write with the [Claude Agent SDK](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview), deploy with Superserve

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install superserve
superserve login
```

Initialize from the root of your project where your dependencies and agent code live:

```bash
superserve init
```

This creates a `superserve.yaml`:

```yaml
name: my-agent
command: python main.py  # edit to match your agent's start command
```

Deploy:

```bash
superserve deploy
```

Set your secrets:

```bash
superserve secrets set my-agent ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

Run your agent:

```bash
superserve run my-agent
```

```
