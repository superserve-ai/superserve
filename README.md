## Features

- **Sandboxed execution** — Every agent runs in a gVisor-isolated container with its own compute, filesystem, and network
- **Persistent workspace** — Storage that survives restarts. Agents pick up where they left off
- **Encrypted secrets** — API keys are encrypted and injected at runtime. Values are never exposed
- **Real-time streaming** — Stream tokens and tool calls as they happen
- **Sub-second cold starts** — Pre-provisioned containers mean your agent starts almost instantly
- **Built for Claude Agent SDK** — Write with the [Claude Agent SDK](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview), deploy with Superserve

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install superserve
superserve login
```

Initialize from the root of your project where your dependencies and agent code live:

```bash
superserve init
```

This creates a `superserve.yaml`:

```yaml
name: my-agent
command: python main.py  # edit to match your agent's start command
```

Deploy:

```bash
superserve deploy
```

Set your secrets:

```bash
superserve secrets set my-agent ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

Run your agent:

```bash
superserve run my-agent
```

```
You > What is the capital of France?

Agent > The capital of France is Paris.

Completed in 1.2s

You > And what's its population?

Agent > Paris has approximately 2.1 million people in the city proper.

Completed in 0.8s
```

## Development

This repo is a monorepo managed with [Bun workspaces](https://bun.sh/docs/install/workspaces) and [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo).

### Structure

```
apps/
  playground/              # React + Vite playground app
packages/
  cli/                     # TypeScript CLI (@superserve/cli)

  biome-config/            # Shared Biome config
```

### Setup

```bash
bun install               # install all dependencies
```

### Commands

```bash
bun run build             # build all packages
bun run dev               # start all dev servers
bun run lint              # lint all packages
bun run typecheck         # type check all packages
bun run test              # run all tests
```

To run a command for a single package:

```bash
bunx turbo run dev --filter=@superserve/playground
bunx turbo run build --filter=@superserve/sdk
```

### Legacy Python CLI

The Python CLI in `src/superserve/` is being replaced by the TypeScript CLI. To work on it:

```bash
uv sync --dev             # install Python dependencies
uv run pytest             # run tests
uv run ruff check .       # lint
```
