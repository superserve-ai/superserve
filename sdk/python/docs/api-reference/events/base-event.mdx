Base class that all event types inherit from.

## Definition

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class BaseEvent(BaseModel):
    run_id: str
    type: str
```

## Properties

<ParamField path="run_id" type="str" required>
  The ID of the run that generated this event.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="type" type="str" required>
  Event type identifier.
</ParamField>

## Event Types

| Type | Event Class |
|------|-------------|
| `run.started` | `RunStartedEvent` |
| `message.delta` | `MessageDeltaEvent` |
| `tool.start` | `ToolStartEvent` |
| `tool.end` | `ToolEndEvent` |
| `run.completed` | `RunCompletedEvent` |
| `run.failed` | `RunFailedEvent` |
| `run.cancelled` | `RunCancelledEvent` |

## Type Union

```python
from superserve_sdk import RunEvent

# RunEvent = Union of all event types
async for event in client.stream("agent", "Hello"):
    event: RunEvent  # Type-safe
```

## Example

```python
from superserve_sdk import Superserve, BaseEvent

async with Superserve() as client:
    async for event in client.stream("agent", "Hello"):
        # All events have run_id and type
        print(f"Run: {event.run_id}, Type: {event.type}")
```
