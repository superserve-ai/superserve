## Examples

<CodeGroup>
```python Async
from superserve_sdk import Superserve, NotFoundError

async with Superserve() as client:
    # Delete by ID
    await client.delete_agent("agt_abc123")

    # Delete by name
    await client.delete_agent("my-agent")

    # Safe delete with error handling
    try:
        await client.delete_agent("maybe-exists")
    except NotFoundError:
        print("Agent already deleted")
```

```python Sync
from superserve_sdk import SuperserveSync

with SuperserveSync() as client:
    client.delete_agent("my-agent")
```
</CodeGroup>

## Cleanup Pattern

```python
# Delete all test agents
async with Superserve() as client:
    agents = await client.list_agents()
    for agent in agents:
        if agent.name.startswith("test-"):
            await client.delete_agent(agent.id)
            print(f"Deleted: {agent.name}")
```
