## Authentication

Authenticate with your Superserve account. Credentials are stored locally.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="superserve login" icon="right-to-bracket">
    ```bash
    superserve login
    ```

    Opens your browser for authentication. Credentials are stored at `~/.superserve/credentials.json`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="superserve logout" icon="right-from-bracket">
    ```bash
    superserve logout
    ```

    Clears stored credentials.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

## Project setup

Generate a `superserve.yaml` config in your project. This defines your agent name, start command, and secrets.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="superserve init" icon="folder-plus">
    ```bash
    superserve init [--name NAME]
    ```

    Creates `superserve.yaml` in the current directory. Defaults the agent name to the directory name.

    ### superserve.yaml

    ```yaml
    name: my-agent          # Required. Lowercase, alphanumeric, hyphens.
    command: python main.py  # Required. Command to start your agent.

    # Environment variables your agent needs to run
    # secrets:
    #   - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

    # Files and directories to exclude from upload
    # ignore:
    #   - .venv
    #   - __pycache__
    #   - .git
    #   - node_modules
    ```

    If a `.env.example` file exists, secrets are auto-detected and added to the YAML.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Deployment

Your code is uploaded and your dependencies are installed on the platform. Agents run inside gVisor-isolated sandbox containers built on a custom base image with Python pre-installed.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="superserve deploy" icon="cloud-arrow-up">
    ```bash
    superserve deploy [--dir PATH] [--json]
    ```

    Deploy your agent. Re-deploying the same name updates the existing agent.

    | Flag | Description |
    |------|-------------|
    | `--dir PATH` | Project directory (default: `.`) |
    | `--json` | Output agent object as JSON |
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

## Secrets

Set API keys and environment variables for your agent.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="superserve secrets set" icon="lock">
    ```bash
    superserve secrets set AGENT KEY=VALUE [KEY=VALUE ...]
    ```

    Set one or more secrets. Existing secrets are preserved.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="superserve secrets list" icon="key">
    ```bash
    superserve secrets list AGENT
    ```

    Shows key names only - values are never returned.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="superserve secrets delete" icon="trash">
    ```bash
    superserve secrets delete AGENT KEY [--yes]
    ```

    Removes a secret. Use `--yes` to skip confirmation.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

## Running agents

Each run creates a session and provisions a sandbox with your code, secrets, and a persistent filesystem. Responses are streamed back in real time via SSE.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="superserve run" icon="play" defaultOpen>
    ```bash
    superserve run AGENT [PROMPT] [--single] [--json]
    ```

    | Flag | Description |
    |------|-------------|
    | `--single` | Exit after one response |
    | `--json` | Output raw SSE events as JSON |

    ```
    $ superserve run my-agent

    You > What is the capital of France?

    Agent > The capital of France is Paris.

    Completed in 1.2s

    You > And what's its population?

    Agent > Paris has approximately 2.1 million people in the city proper.

    Completed in 0.8s
    ```

    **Single-turn:**

    ```bash
    superserve run my-agent "Hello" --single
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="superserve sessions list" icon="list">
    ```bash
    superserve sessions list [AGENT] [--status STATUS] [--json]
    ```
