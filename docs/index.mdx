Superserve packages your agent code and deploys it to a sandboxed cloud container - one CLI command, no infrastructure config.

```bash
pip install superserve
```

## Why Superserve

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Sandboxed execution" icon="shield">
    Every agent session runs in a gVisor-isolated container with its own compute, filesystem, and network.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Persistent workspace" icon="hard-drive">
    Storage that survives restarts and long inactivity. Agents pick up where they left off.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Unlimited sessions" icon="infinity">
    No session duration caps or CPU-time limits. Agents run as long as they need - hours or days.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Sub-second cold starts" icon="gauge-high">
    Pre-provisioned containers mean your agent starts almost instantly.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Encrypted secrets" icon="lock">
    API keys are encrypted and injected at runtime. Values are never exposed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Real-time streaming" icon="bolt">
    Stream tokens and tool calls as they happen. See what your agent is thinking and doing.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
