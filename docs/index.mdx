Superserve takes your agent script and gives it a sandboxed cloud endpoint — streaming, sessions, secrets, and persistent storage included.

```bash
pip install superserve
superserve deploy agent.py
```

## Why Superserve

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Zero config" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Point at a script, deploy. No decorators, no YAML, no Dockerfiles. Your code runs as-is.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Sandboxed execution" icon="shield">
    Every session runs in an isolated microVM with its own compute, filesystem, and network.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Persistent workspace" icon="hard-drive">
    Storage that survives restarts and long inactivity. Agents pick up where they left off.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Sub-second cold starts" icon="gauge-high">
    Pre-built templates mean your agent starts in under a second.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Encrypted secrets" icon="lock">
    API keys are encrypted at rest and injected at runtime. Values are never exposed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Real-time streaming" icon="bolt">
    Stream tokens and tool calls as they happen via SSE.
  </Card>

## Two ways to deploy

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Zero-config" icon="wand-magic-sparkles" href="/zero-config">
    ```bash
    superserve deploy agent.py
    ```
    No code changes. Works with any framework — Claude Agent SDK, OpenAI Agents SDK, LangGraph, or plain Python. Best for getting started and prototyping.
  </Card>
  <Card title="SDK integration" icon="code" href="/quickstart#add-superserve-to-your-agent">
    ```python
    from superserve import App
    app = App(name="my-agent")
    ```
    Import the Superserve SDK for fine-grained control — status messages, structured metadata, and custom streaming. Best for production agents.
