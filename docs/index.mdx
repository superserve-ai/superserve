description: "Agent sandboxes with sessions, streaming, and zero-config deploys"
---

Superserve deploys your agent script to an isolated cloud sandbox — no Dockerfile, no server code, no infrastructure config.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/superserve-ai/superserve/main/cli/install.sh | sh
```

```bash
superserve deploy agent.py
```

The same script you run with `python agent.py` on your laptop runs in production. Each session gets its own [Firecracker microVM](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/) with:

- **Hardware-level isolation** — separate kernel, filesystem, and network per session. Agents can execute code and use tools without risk of cross-session data leaks.
- **Durable workspace** — the agent's `/workspace` filesystem persists across turns and restarts. Resume a conversation days later and every file is exactly where the agent left it.
- **Session management** — multi-turn conversation state handled by the platform. No database, no serialization logic, no routing code.
- **Real-time streaming** — responses stream back via SSE as the agent works.
- **~400ms cold starts** — pre-built sandbox templates with your dependencies baked in.

```bash
$ superserve run my-agent "Review the error handling in src/auth.ts — are we leaking stack traces?"

Analyzing src/auth.ts and src/middleware/auth.ts...

Found 2 issues:
1. Line 47: `catch(e) { res.json({ error: e.message }) }`
   Leaks internal error details to clients. Return a generic 500 and
   log the full error server-side.
2. Line 82: Bare `catch {}` swallows errors silently.
   At minimum, log the error. Better: re-throw after logging.

The rest of the error handling looks correct — login() and refreshToken()
both use structured error responses.

Completed in 3.8s

## Works with any agent framework

Superserve runs your code as-is. No SDK lock-in, no framework requirements.

## Roadmap

We're building the production layer for AI agents. Here's what's coming next — [tell us what matters most](mailto:founders@superserve.ai).

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Credential proxy" icon="shield-halved">
    HTTP requests from inside the sandbox go through a proxy that injects API keys at the network level. The agent makes authenticated requests without ever seeing the credentials — they never appear in the LLM context, logs, or tool outputs. Configure once, use everywhere.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Agent observability" icon="chart-mixed">
    Every tool call, file write, and HTTP request the agent makes — logged and queryable. Get a full execution timeline for each session, not just the chat transcript. Know exactly what your agent did and why.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Spend limits and circuit breakers" icon="brake-warning">
    Set per-session and per-agent cost caps. If an agent enters a loop making expensive API calls, the sandbox kills it before you get a surprise bill. Configurable: max turns, max duration, max API spend.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Shared filesystems across agents" icon="folder-tree">
    Mount a durable filesystem into multiple sandboxes simultaneously. Agents can share data, artifacts, and context without re-uploading files or wiring object-store plumbing. Live collaboration between agents.
  </Card>
