## The problem with running agents

AI agents need freedom to execute code, install packages, read files, make network requests. On your laptop, that freedom can delete files and leak credentials. In production, multiply that across every user session. Either way, you end up building infrastructure instead of building agents.

You need real isolation — separate kernel, separate filesystem, separate network — that scales from one developer to a team shipping agents to thousands of users.

## Superserve gives agents their own machine

Every session runs in its own [Firecracker microVM](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/). The agent gets full root access to its sandbox. It can execute code, install packages, write files, make HTTP requests. Nothing it does can touch your infrastructure or leak into another session.

Deploy with one command. No Dockerfile, no server code, no config files.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Python
superserve deploy agent.py
```

```bash TypeScript
superserve deploy agent.ts
```

</CodeGroup>

The same script you run locally runs in production. Superserve detects your dependencies, builds the sandbox, and serves your agent over a streaming API. Cold starts take ~400ms.

## Nothing disappears between sessions

Most sandboxes are ephemeral. The agent writes a file, the session ends, the file is gone. Every conversation starts from zero. That works for demos, not for production.

Superserve workspaces persist. The `/workspace` filesystem survives across turns, restarts, and days. Resume a session on Thursday that you started on Monday — every file is where the agent left it, and the full conversation history is intact.

## Works with any agent framework

Superserve runs your code as-is. No SDK lock-in, no framework requirements — if it reads input and prints output, it deploys.

## Roadmap

Here's what's coming next — [tell us what matters most](mailto:founders@superserve.ai).

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Credential proxy" icon="shield-halved">
    HTTP requests from inside the sandbox go through a proxy that injects API keys at the network level. The agent makes authenticated requests without ever seeing the credentials — they never appear in the LLM context, logs, or tool outputs. Configure once, use everywhere.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Agent observability" icon="chart-mixed">
    Every tool call, file write, and HTTP request the agent makes — logged and queryable. Get a full execution timeline for each session, not just the chat transcript. Know exactly what your agent did and why.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Spend limits and circuit breakers" icon="brake-warning">
    Set per-session and per-agent cost caps. If an agent enters a loop making expensive API calls, the sandbox kills it before you get a surprise bill. Configurable: max turns, max duration, max API spend.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Shared filesystems across agents" icon="folder-tree">
    Mount a durable filesystem into multiple sandboxes simultaneously. Agents can share data, artifacts, and context without re-uploading files or wiring object-store plumbing. Live collaboration between agents.
  </Card>
