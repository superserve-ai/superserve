description: "Persistent conversations that survive restarts"
---

Every `superserve run` creates a session — an isolated sandbox running your agent, with its own filesystem and process state. Sessions persist after the conversation ends. Come back hours or days later and resume where you left off.

## Resume a conversation

```bash
$ superserve sessions list my-agent

ID             TITLE                              STATUS   MSGS   LAST ACTIVE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
a1b2c3d4e5f6   Review auth module error handling   idle     4      2 minutes ago
f6e5d4c3b2a1   Refactor database migrations        idle     12     1 hour ago
```

```bash
$ superserve sessions resume a1b2

Resumed: "Review auth module error handling" (my-agent)

You> Did you apply both fixes?

Yes — both issues in auth/middleware.py are fixed. Line 47 now returns
a generic 500 with the original exception logged via structlog. Line 82
uses `except Exception:` instead of bare `except:`.

Completed in 2.1s
```

The agent remembers the full conversation. Files it created or modified are still in the workspace.

## How persistence works

Sessions use two layers of persistence:

1. **Workspace filesystem** — Superserve persists the sandbox's `/workspace` directory. Files your agent reads, writes, or modifies survive across turns and restarts.

2. **Conversation memory** — If your agent uses the Claude Agent SDK with `session_id`, Claude maintains conversation history on disk. Combined with workspace persistence, the agent has full context even after the sandbox restarts.

```python
# Pass session_id to enable conversation memory
await client.query(prompt=user_input, session_id="chat")
```

One parameter. Memory works even when the underlying sandbox instance changes.

## Session lifecycle

| Status | Meaning | Resumable? |
|--------|---------|------------|
| `active` | Processing a message right now | No |
| `idle` | Waiting for the next message | Yes |
| `completed` | Ended by user | Yes — fresh sandbox, same workspace |
| `failed` | Crashed or timed out | Yes — fresh sandbox, same workspace |

```bash
# View details
superserve sessions get a1b2

# End a session (workspace is preserved)
superserve sessions end a1b2
```
