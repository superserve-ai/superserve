# Hosted Agents

Superserve Hosted Agents lets you deploy Claude AI agents to production in minutes, not weeks.

## What are Hosted Agents?

Hosted Agents is a managed service that handles all the infrastructure complexity of running AI agents:

- **Secure Execution**: Agents run in isolated gVisor sandboxes
- **Real-time Streaming**: Get live output via Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- **Automatic Scaling**: Warm pools ensure sub-second startup times
- **Usage Tracking**: Monitor tokens, turns, and costs automatically
- **Simple API**: RESTful API with streaming support

## How It Works

    participant User
    participant API
    participant Sandbox
    participant Claude

    User->>API: POST /runs (create run)
    API->>Sandbox: Allocate from warm pool
    Sandbox->>Claude: Execute agent
    Claude-->>Sandbox: Stream response
    Sandbox-->>API: SSE events
    API-->>User: Stream events
```
