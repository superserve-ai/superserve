# Quickstart

This guide will walk you through deploying and running your first hosted agent.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- A Superserve account ([sign up free](https://superserve.ai))

## Step 1: Install the CLI

```bash
pip install superserve
```

## Step 2: Authenticate

```bash
superserve login
```

This opens your browser to complete OAuth authentication.

## Step 3: Create an Agent

Create your first agent with a system prompt:

```bash
superserve agents create \
  --name my-first-agent \
  --system-prompt "You are a helpful assistant. Be concise." \
  --tools Bash,Read,Write
```

You should see:
```
Created agent 'my-first-agent' (agt_abc123)
```

## Step 4: Run the Agent

Execute your agent with a prompt:

```bash
superserve run my-first-agent "What is the capital of France?"
```

You'll see the streaming output:
```
The capital of France is Paris.

Completed in 1.2s (150 input / 12 output tokens)
```

## Step 5: View Run History

See your recent runs:

```bash
superserve runs list
```

```
ID                   AGENT                STATUS       DURATION   CREATED
run_def456...        agt_abc123...        completed    1.2s       2026-02-07 10:05
```

## Using the API

You can also use the REST API directly:

### Create an Agent

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.superserve.ai/v1/agents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "my-api-agent",
    "system_prompt": "Be helpful and concise.",
    "tools": ["Bash", "Read", "Write"]
  }'
```

### Run the Agent

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.superserve.ai/v1/runs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "agent_id": "agt_abc123",
    "prompt": "What is 2+2?"
  }'
```

### Stream Events

```bash
curl -N https://api.superserve.ai/v1/runs/run_def456/events \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```
