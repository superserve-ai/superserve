The [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python) provides a lightweight framework for building agents with tool use, handoffs between agents, and input/output guardrails.

```python agent.py
from agents import Agent, Runner

agent = Agent(
    name="assistant",
    instructions="You are a helpful assistant.",
)

while True:
    try:
        user_input = input()
    except EOFError:
        break
    result = Runner.run_sync(agent, user_input)
    print(result.final_output)
```

```txt requirements.txt
openai-agents
```

```bash
superserve deploy agent.py
superserve secrets set my-agent OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
superserve run my-agent
```
