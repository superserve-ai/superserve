title: "Zero-Config Deploy"
description: "Deploy scripts to Superserve without config files or code changes"
---

```bash
superserve deploy agent.py
```

Your script runs as-is in the cloud — no Dockerfile, no server code, no config files. Superserve packages your project, detects dependencies from `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`, and runs your entrypoint inside an isolated sandbox.

## Stdio mode (default)

Scripts that use `input()` and `print()` get multi-turn conversation support automatically. Each `input()` call receives the next user message; each `print()` streams the response back.

```bash
superserve deploy agent.py
```

## HTTP server mode

If your agent runs its own HTTP server, pass `--port` and Superserve proxies requests to it:

```bash
superserve deploy server.py --port 8000
```

Superserve forwards to `localhost:PORT/run` inside the sandbox. Use this for custom endpoints, WebSocket connections, or when your agent serves a frontend alongside the API.
