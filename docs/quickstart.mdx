  **Prerequisites:** Python 3.12+ and a [Superserve account](https://console.superserve.ai).
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the CLI">
    ```bash
    pip install superserve
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Log in">
    ```bash
    superserve login
    ```
    Opens your browser to authenticate. Credentials are saved locally at `~/.superserve/credentials.json`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Initialize your project">
    <Note>
      Run `superserve init` from the root of your project - where your dependencies (`requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`) and agent code live.
    </Note>

    ```bash
    superserve init
    ```

    This creates `superserve.yaml` in your project directory:

    ```yaml
    name: my-agent
    command: python main.py
    ```

    Set `command` to whatever starts your agent.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy">
    ```bash
    superserve deploy
    ```

    ```
    ✓ Packaging project... (4 KB)
    ✓ Uploading to Superserve...
    ✓ Installing dependencies... (12s)

    Deployed 'my-agent' in 15s

    superserve run my-agent "your prompt here"
    ```

    Dependencies are auto-detected from `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set your API keys">
    ```bash
    superserve secrets set my-agent ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
    ```
    <Tip>
      Secrets are encrypted and injected as environment variables at runtime. You can set multiple keys at once.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run it">
    ```bash
    superserve run my-agent
    ```
