<Info>
  **Prerequisites:** Python 3.12+, a [Claude Agent SDK](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agent-sdk) project, and a [Superserve account](https://console.superserve.ai).
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the CLI">
    ```bash
    pip install superserve
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Log in">
    ```bash
    superserve login
    ```
    Opens your browser to authenticate. Credentials are saved locally at `~/.superserve/credentials.json`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Superserve to your agent">
    A few lines connect your agent to Superserve - see [below](#add-superserve-to-your-agent).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Initialize your project">
    <Note>
      Run `superserve init` from the root of your project - where your dependencies (`requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`) and agent code live.
    </Note>

    ```bash
    superserve init
    ```

    This creates `superserve.yaml` in your project directory:

    ```yaml
    name: my-agent
    command: python agent.py
    ```

    Set `command` to whatever starts your agent.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy">
    ```bash
    superserve deploy
    ```

    ```
    ✓ Packaging project... (4 KB)
    ✓ Uploading to Superserve...
    ✓ Installing dependencies... (12s)

    Deployed 'my-agent' in 15s

    superserve run my-agent "your prompt here"
    ```

    Dependencies are auto-detected from `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set your API keys">
    ```bash
    superserve secrets set my-agent ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
    ```
    <Tip>
      Secrets are encrypted and injected as environment variables at runtime. You can set multiple keys at once.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run it">
    ```bash
    superserve run my-agent
    ```

    ```
    You> What is the capital of France?
    The capital of France is Paris.

    Completed in 1.2s

    You> And what's its population?
    Paris has approximately 2.1 million people in the city proper.

    Completed in 0.8s

## Add Superserve to your agent

A few lines connect your Claude Agent SDK script to Superserve:

<CodeGroup>

```python Your agent
from claude_agent_sdk import (
    AssistantMessage,
    ClaudeAgentOptions,
    ClaudeSDKClient,
    ResultMessage,
    TextBlock,
    ToolUseBlock,
)

options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant.",
    model="haiku",
    permission_mode="bypassPermissions",
)

async def run(prompt: str):
    async with ClaudeSDKClient(options=options) as client:
        await client.query(prompt=prompt)

        async for msg in client.receive_response():
            if isinstance(msg, AssistantMessage):
                for block in msg.content:
                    if isinstance(block, TextBlock):
                        print(block.text)
            elif isinstance(msg, ResultMessage):
                print(f"Cost: ${msg.total_cost_usd}")
```

```python With Superserve
from claude_agent_sdk import (
    AssistantMessage,
    ClaudeAgentOptions,
    ClaudeSDKClient,
    ResultMessage,
    TextBlock,
    ToolUseBlock,
)
from superserve import App                        # 1. Import

app = App(name="my-agent")                        # 2. Declare

options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant.",
    model="haiku",
    permission_mode="bypassPermissions",
)

@app.session                                      # 3. Decorate
async def run(session):
    async with ClaudeSDKClient(options=options) as client:
        async for message, stream in session.turns():  # 4. Multi-turn loop
            stream.status("Thinking...")
            await client.query(prompt=message)

            async for msg in client.receive_response():
                if isinstance(msg, AssistantMessage):
                    for block in msg.content:
                        if isinstance(block, TextBlock):
                            stream.write(block.text)   # 5. Stream back
                elif isinstance(msg, ResultMessage):
                    stream.metadata({"cost_usd": msg.total_cost_usd})

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()                                     # 6. Start
```

</CodeGroup>

**What changed:**

| Addition | What it does |
|----------|-------------|
| `App(name="my-agent")` | Names your agent for deployment and CLI access |
| `@app.session` | Marks your function as the entry point Superserve calls on each session |
| `session.turns()` | Async loop that receives user messages and gives you a `stream` to respond |
| `stream.write()` | Sends text back to the user in real-time (replaces `print()`) |
| `stream.status()` | Shows progress to the user while the agent works (e.g. tool calls, thinking) |
| `app.run()` | Connects your agent to the Superserve runtime |
