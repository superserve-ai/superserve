<Info>
  **You need:** A [Superserve account](https://console.superserve.ai).
</Info>

## Install and log in

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/superserve-ai/superserve/main/cli/install.sh | sh
superserve login
```

## Write an agent (or use one you already have)

Any script that uses `input()` and `print()` works. Here's one with the Claude Agent SDK:

```python agent.py
import asyncio
from claude_agent_sdk import ClaudeAgentOptions, ClaudeSDKClient, TextBlock

options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    model="sonnet",
    system_prompt="You are a senior software engineer. Be direct and specific.",
    permission_mode="bypassPermissions",
)

async def main():
    async with ClaudeSDKClient(options=options) as client:
        while True:
            user_input = input()
            await client.query(prompt=user_input, session_id="chat")
            async for msg in client.receive_response():
                for block in getattr(msg, "content", []):
                    if isinstance(block, TextBlock):
                        print(block.text)

asyncio.run(main())
```

This is the same script you'd run locally with `python agent.py`. Nothing has been added to make it deployable.

## Deploy

```bash
superserve deploy agent.py
```

```
✓ Packaging project... (4 KB)
✓ Uploading...
✓ Installing dependencies... (12s)

Deployed 'my-project' in 15s
```

Dependencies are detected from `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` automatically.

## Set your API keys

```bash
superserve secrets set my-project ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

Secrets are encrypted at rest and injected as environment variables when your agent runs.

## Run it

```bash
superserve run my-project
```

```
You> Review the error handling in our auth module. Are we leaking stack traces?

I'll analyze the auth module for error handling issues.

Found 2 problems in `auth/middleware.py`:

1. **Line 47**: `except Exception as e: return {"error": str(e)}`
   Leaks internal error messages to clients. Replace with a generic 500
   response and log the full exception server-side.

2. **Line 82**: Bare `except:` clause catches SystemExit and KeyboardInterrupt.
   Use `except Exception:` instead.

The rest of the error handling looks correct — `login()` and `refresh_token()`
both use structured error responses without exposing internals.

Completed in 3.8s

The agent remembers context between turns. The sandbox persists files across the conversation. Come back tomorrow and [resume where you left off](/sessions).
